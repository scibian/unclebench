== Unclebench architecture

=== Class diagram 
The Unclebench architecture is described on the following figure:

=== Main Unclebench classes

**Ubench_cmd** manages user commands and handles the different avaible options. It uses a Scheduler interface to handle
scheduler dependent commandes (like choosing to run on specific nodes with the -w option).

**AutoBenchmarker** builds a list of benchmark managers from the path to the directory containing their description files.
It provides methods to retrieve benchmark managers from their names and to build global performance reports. 

**BenchmarkManager** is the central class of Unclebench. Initilized from a platform and a benchmark name it manages all the
step from running the benchmark to printing results and building a performance report. Benchmarks specific plugins that define
the report part are derived from this Class.
 
== Unclebench interfaces

=== Scheduler interface

The schedulerInterface is an abstract class which is implemented by **SlurmInterface**. To make Unclebench compatible
with other job schedulers one has to implement a new class derivated from schedulerInterface and do few changes to the **Ubench_cmd** class.

=== Benchmarking tool interface

This abstract class is meant to generalize the way Unclebench is interacting with Jube thus making it easier to eventually add other
benchmarking environment engines. This kind of change would however require to adapt the platform and benchmark description files.

=== BenchmarkManager and plugins

Report plugins are built by derivating BenchmarkManager class to a LocalBenchmarkManager that has to be located in the plugin directory. This directory can be customized by setting UBENCH_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable.
